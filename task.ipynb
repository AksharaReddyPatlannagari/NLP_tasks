    "Discuss the implications and advantages of each scenario and explain your rationale as to how\n",
    "the model should be trained given the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If the entire network should be frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implications: It means that no parameters (transformer backbone or task heads) are updated during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Avoids overfitting especially if the dataset is very small.\n",
    "    - Skipping backpropagation through the transformer also decreases the computation time. and will result in minimal memory and GPU/CPU usage which is perfect for resource-constrained environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rationale: Freezing the entire network is rarely optimal but can work if the pre-trained model already captures task-relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If only the transformer backbone should be frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implications: Here transformerâ€™s parameters remain fixed, but task-specific heads are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Uses the power of pre-trained models while tailoring heads to new tasks.\n",
    "    - There's less chance of overfitting due to reduced number of trainable parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rationale: The transformer backbone generates strong, general embeddings, while the task-specific heads fine-tune these features for specific goalsâ€”without disrupting the core model's stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If only one of the task-specific heads (either for Task A or Task B) should be frozen.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Implications: Here, one head remains frozen, while the backbone and the other head are trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It gives me the opportunity to prioritize on the harder task.\n",
    "    - The trainable head can refine the shared representations to better suit its specific task, without being influenced by the frozen head.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Rationale: By freezing one head, we prevent it from influencing the gradient updates. This helps the backbone focus on learning features that are more useful for the task we're actively training.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where transfer learning can be beneficial. Explain how you would approach the transfer learning process, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "The key benefit of transfer learning is that it significantly reduces the amount of data and computational resources needed for training, especially when the new task has limited data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The choice of a pre-trained model: For this project, I selected the BERT-base model as the pre-trained backbone due to its strong general-purpose language understanding capabilities, making it well-suited for a wide range of NLP tasks. Since my dataset is small and self-made, using a pre-trained model helps overcome data limitations by providing a strong understanding of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The layers you would freeze/unfreeze: For this project, I would freeze the lower transformer layers of the BERT model, which are responsible for capturing general linguistic patterns. I would unfreeze and fine-tune the upper layers and task-specific heads, as they are more adaptable to the classification and Named Entity Recognition(NER) tasks at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The rationale behind these choices: Freezing the lower layers helps preserve the foundational language understanding acquired during pre-training and minimizes the risk of overfitting, especially given the small. Then, by fine-tuning the upper layers and task-specific heads, the model will adjust to the specific domain and task requirements."

This performance gap suggests that classification is a simpler task for the model to learn, likely due to its fewer output classes and less complex structure. In contrast, NER involves more intricate label dependencies and appears to benefit less from the limited data.\n",

However, this rapid improvement is likely a result of overfitting on the small, artificially constructed dataset. The steady decline in loss across epochs further confirms that the model is optimizing well within this constrained setting.\n",

To improve robustness and ensure practical reliability, the next step would be to evaluate the model on a larger and more diverse dataset, along with more rigorous validation."
